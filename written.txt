Q1. 
a. 000000 10001 00010 01001 00000 100110 = xor $t1, $s1, $v0

b. lw $t3, 8($s1) = 100011 10001 01011 00000 00000 001000

Q2. 
a. Not counting labels and data, the non optimized version has 56 instructions and the optimized version has 31 
instructions. 

b. The non optimized version has 17 load and store instructions, the optimized version has 6 load and store instructions. 

c. Excluding $sp, $fp, and $ra, the non optimized version uses 3 different registers. The optimized versino uses 9 
different registers. 

d. The non optimized code is in blocks and the optimized code is in strips. This shows that the optimized code is not 
performing the C instructions line by line, but rather interleaved. 

e. More optimized code seems to make use of more registers and use fewer store and load instructions. Making use of more 
registers allows the program to complete tasks concurrently without having to wait for used registers to free up, and 
fewer store and load instructions speeds up data transfer.
